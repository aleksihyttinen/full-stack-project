React map is my first full-stack app. 
This app was developed as course work for my backend studies.

The frontend is coded with React.js, backend with Node.js/Express.

This app is hosted at https://qmalhy-map.herokuapp.com/
You can add new locations by double-clicking the map, or view coordinates of a location by clicking a pin on the map.
